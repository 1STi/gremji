# Gremji
Gremji is a Go driver to use with Gremlin in graph databases.

## About the name
The name comes from the [Blizzard's Overwatch character](https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/genji/), Genji. 
It's a mix of the names Gremlin and Genji.

## Motivation and main focus
We couldn't be able to find a maintained and useful driver for Go to use in our products. 
The main focus of this project is to run on top of [Apache Tinkerpop](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/).

## Contributing
We're working on our contributing guidelines. Meanwhile any PR is welcome and will be analyzed.
